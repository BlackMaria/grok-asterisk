Grok patterns for Asterisk log
==============================

This is a small test for using [grok](http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/wiki/Grok)

tool like [Logstash](http://logstash.net/).

Ruby script inspired by http://blog.bealetech.com/content/testing-logstash-grok-filters

The Asterisk-specifc patterns are located in the file patterns/pure-ruby/asterisk
